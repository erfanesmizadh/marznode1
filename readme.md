# MarzNode Script

The `marznode` script helps manage the installation, updates and maintenance of MarzNode and its Xray core dependencies. This tool includes commands for installing and controlling the MarzNode service (with `custom xray version`), as well as a built-in system for checking and installing required dependencies.

why is archive? because rate of adding Marzneshin cores was faster than my update speed.

## Features

- **Install/Uninstall MarzNode**: Easily install or remove MarzNode.
- **Start/Stop/Restart**: Manage the MarzNode service (start, stop, or restart).
- **Logs**: View recent MarzNode logs.
- **Docker Integration**: MarzNode runs as a Docker service.
- **Custom Port Configuration**: Specify the service port during installation.
